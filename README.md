# Basic Weather App
  This project simply shows the weather of a specified area and a background image associated with it. After typing in a city that you would like to see the weather of, the program calls the Open Weather API to present
  information about the specified city. Information such as Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed are displayed. The Custom Google Search Engine API is called to show the image of any city available.
### Technologies Used
  HTML, CSS, Javascript, OpenWeather API, Google Custom Search Engine API
